            <h1>AI OpenHack</h1>
            <br />
            <p>AI technologies enable intelligent, scalable, and adaptive solutions that enhance business operations and user experiences. They accelerate innovation by enabling systems to perceive, learn, and act without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. With tools like Azure AI Services, Azure Machine Learning, and Cognitive Services, organizations, from startups to enterprises, are integrating AI into their applications to automate tasks, uncover insights, and personalize user engagement.</p>
            <br />
            <p>These AI services seamlessly integrate with the broader Azure ecosystem and support everything from vision and language understanding to decision-making models. As you progress through this OpenHack, these capabilities will form the foundation of your challenges and will empower you to build smarter, more responsive solutions that drive real-world impact.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <br />
            <p>In the heart of a technologically advanced city, an unexpected natural disaster strikes, heavy rainfall overwhelms infrastructure and floods major districts. As waters rise, panic sets in. Roads are blocked, communication lines are burdened, and emergency services are stretched thin.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In this high-stakes situation, city officials have turned to a team of student developers for innovative support. Using Microsoft Azure’s powerful AI capabilities, this team must help the city make sense of the chaos, identify citizens in danger, prioritize rescue efforts, and relay critical information efficiently.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Time is short, data is pouring in from all directions, and lives are at risk. You’ve been selected to join the response team—are you ready to build the AI-powered tools that can make a difference?</p>
